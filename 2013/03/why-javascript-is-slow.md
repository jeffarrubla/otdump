Why javascript is slow
=================

Just read a [https://speakerdeck.com/alex/why-python-ruby-and-javascript-are-slow](https://speakerdeck.com/alex/why-python-ruby-and-javascript-are-slow) .
Very insightful  I guess its things that we ("we", the old folks that learned coding in C and evolved to JS and Python) knew once and forgot along the way.
Also liked the fact that the speakerdeck  was having in the notes the transcript of what the speaker says in every slide. It is what I read - not the slides... I loved it.
