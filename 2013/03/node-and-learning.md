Node and learning
=================

Spending 1 hr reading and 10 minutes coding seems to be my current ratio..in using/learning nodejs
Things go still very slowly but they are moving forward.
Things I have learned today:

1. Its nice to put a picture in your [project's readme](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) - just like I do in the blogs - not sure if this is common everywhere but many node-folks do it.
2. Node is making people re-examine, return back to the basic unix philosophies - see for example [shoe](https://github.com/substack/shoe)
3. [The art of unix programming](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html#id2877537) by Eric Raymond (the [cathedral/bazaar guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)) seems to becoming a simple way to explain design choices (I guess its mostly Ken Thompson's philosophy - Eric is just the muse)

4. You can always find people that have thought what you have thought and wrote about it - but the trivial differences in their perspectives can drive to  a completely different path [crowdfunder paas](http://tombh.co.uk/crowdfunded-paas/) leading to [open sourced heroku](https://github.com/openruko)
5. What I thought was a friend's unique programming model seems to be followed by a good portion of nodejs community. Node makes you want to unify the writing of your client and server code and that results in some of the common challenges/solutions/patterns being faced and addressed by many members of the community.
6. Still haven't looked how to produce this

image in my project's home pages. Its not that I have anything that builds and passes - I gues I do - even my helloworlds should have that...
7. The guy that wrote shoe and browserify works/has a company called [browserling.com](https://browserling.com/) . Very simple easy and for occassional use free, sessions with any major-browser/resolution/versions to facilitate browser testing
