Escalators - why no progress there
=================

I must have been a small child 40 yrs ago? when I first saw escalators.
I remember they were scary, and I avoid making the first step on them for year. I actually think I remember the first time I let go and step on it.
40 yr later escalator are identical. Not a single change in that invention.
The pattern used for the "merging" of the steps, the elastic handle, even the color everything.
It seems like the perfect invention one that never needed again to be revisited.

But still today I don't like escalator. The vertical lines confuse the depth sensing of my eyes and I am less confident about how far they are.
I don't know the etiquette. Should I pass or not. Am I standing on the way of others or not.
Is this an appropriate distance from someone else but or not. Aren't they going too slow? why don't they accelerate, I guess its impossible by design.
Why are they open? are they only made for stores where you are supposed to be browsing as you are sliding?

The reason that I dislike them the most is I think that I can't think of an obvious way to improve them.
They are standing as an annoying argument against my ever accelerating progragress and change of everything

And so are revolving doors.
