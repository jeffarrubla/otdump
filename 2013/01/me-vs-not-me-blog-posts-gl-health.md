me vs not-me blog posts : GL Health Status Indicator
=================

Reading the blog of my friend gl I think I know when he is up or down. I can tell that because he captures in his blog all concrete thoughts of his, and my simplistic pattern matching is that when the frequency of posts about "introspection" increase he is really a bit depressed and he tries to understand why and that put him in an introspective phase. Its a noise weak signalâ€¦ but then I thought the frequency of the blogs is steady and sufficient so my friend can actually start monitoring the extent of the time that he is introspecting himself over which is obviously an introspecting activity in itself but it could help in regulating it.

So what needs to be done, possibly with the help of a crowdsourced tag is for my friend to get an neutral assessment whether the blog was an Introspective blog or not. then he maintain a chart of the percent of blogs in a week/month of blogs that are about introspection, see the long term pattern and as long as the observation doesn't affect the actual experiment (by avoiding to post introspective blogs to avoid being observed)
etc.
