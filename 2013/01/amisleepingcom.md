AmISleeping.com
===============

Ok ,here is the problem:
A friend has atypical sleep patterns. No problem, he lives in a world that allows for flexible schedules , no mandatory recurring meetings and given that he hasn't yet a wife and children he really shoudn't care a bit. He should be following whatever patterns are making him happy and productive.
There is only one small issue: how do his friends know whether he is awake or not or when is he going to be online. For that matter it may even be interesting for him to know what has been his sleep rythm as of late.

So what is a minimal service that would solve this problem.
Lets call this service amisleeping.com  (the domain is actually available!)
The service would need to have a mobile-friendly html page with a button that says
[Going to bed] or [Just Woke up] and has after that a table of previous times that I have been awake.


The buttons would submit to a loggin data service the event. The js of the page would just read the logs data and display

The service could possibly use the openkeyval service - it may not be hard to allow for multi-user and read only sharing without any server component besides whatever is available as part of openkeyval and a github project page to host the actual amisleeping.com home page.
