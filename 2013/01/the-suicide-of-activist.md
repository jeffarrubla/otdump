the suicide of the activist 
=================

I usually have a way to shield myself from bad stuff that happens around the world - no matter how horrific they are.
I don't read newspapers. I don't really watch news. I just talk with a very narrow circle of friends.
But this particular event keeps going back at the center of my focus.
In part it is because it is a very sad case about someone that could be happening to any of my friends.
In part because I cannot fully understand it. There is no good and evil here.
It would be nice to assume that this happened because 
	bad people 
		having powerful positions, 
      		ignorant about technology, about change, about the new models/ethics that are underlying every single positive trend in the world today
      		 	only caring about their own self-rightness or 
      		 		even worse their own personal bureaucratic ambitions or 
      		 			even worse because they are being financed by evil corporations, modern 
variants of rober-barronsâ€¦.
did that.

But in this case the persons behind the state's prosecution are intelligent, knowledgable people, that truly care to do what is the right thing.

How will these folks feel today? They can't be feeling good. They will be feeling horrible and guilty. They won't be using the excuse - the activist was a depressed individual - its not my doing.. because then that would be a good enough excuse for any internet/social network bully. 

I think until society finds a way to deal with the sensitivity that is required in handling people like Aaron, some of the most unique minds will not have a chance to bloom.
Most of the people I know that belong in this category need to fight a massive battle every day just to wake up.
Just to find the courage to deal with the complexity exposed by the brain in every single step. 
They have to deal with people laughing behind their back.
They have to deal with parents that give them pills to get better. 
They have to deal with friends abandoning them because they are a burden.
They have to see the world and all their colleagues around them doing sub-optimal decisions every moment of the day and they have to deal with it.
They have to deal with the loneliness of nobody understand them.
They have to see people become rich from their inventions. 
They have to see others attract the girls/guys that they would like.

And in spite of that they manage to be philanthropist. Create software for the common good. Solve everyone else problems. Bravely defend online those that are weak - even without a hint of body-building in their body.
