If I am doing the right things I should be happy - independently of the outcome
=================

The last weeks I feel pretty negative. I am not unhappy, but my continuous integral of my very happy, happy, sad, very sad (note that there is no neutral) moments is quite lower than usual.
I know why. My efforts at work are not meeting the success I would have hope - not in terms of actual work but in terms of the people-stuff. People are unhappy with other people and most of my efforts to fix/improve that have been having moderate if any success.
And I know I am not good at doing that - managing people. I don't really understand people. There too many hidden variables the complexities are not the sort I can abstract. 

So this morning I told myself something that I have said to me in the past and it worked. I am happier. It may be the morning vs evening but I am storing for further reuse.

I should be happy with myself given that I am doing truly all I can do - even if I am doing something that I am not the best at it.
The way this is consistent with my theory that "one is only happy if they are happy with their work
and one is happy with their work if they feel that they are really good at what they do" is that your time both at the short and the long scale
has to be spread in myriad of activities. I am an awful typer - I am a moderate driver - I am a less than average speaker - still I have to do all those things every day and I am happy as long as I am doing my best at them - even if my best is not "good enough" for the situation at hand.
As long as I am maintaining a long term perspective under which I am putting a significant/sufficient part of my time in what I am really good at â€¦. then I should be happy with myself
