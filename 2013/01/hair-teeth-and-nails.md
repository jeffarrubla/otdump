Hair teeth and nails
=================

Every morning I am spending any time between 5-30 minutes in a routine that I would have rather not being a necessary %percent of my waking life.
I take a shower, optionally (50% freq) I shampoo my hair, I brush my teeth, optionally shave (50%), optionally clip my hand nails (5%), same for toe (3%). Also at the 4% frequency (once every 4 weeks) I visit the hairdresser to cut my hair, trim my eyebrows (since 45yrs old) (and possibly after a certain age I will be trimming my ear and nose hair. I put gel in my hair to minimize subsequent position change and avoid need for brushing and put antiperspirant in my armpits.
I weigh myself - trying to calculate the amount of fuel net change (i.e. not food in my stomach/interstine) but actual yellow fat=fuel in my body) in a digital scale that requires about a 1-2 mins to calibrate and scale properly.
I exchange smalltalk and pleasantries with whoever is awake make a frappe and go online

The common element on this waking up routine is that they are dealing with the care of the dead parts of my body - where I am describing as dead the nails teeth and hair - even though they are in some sense part of a live bigger cell[s] system.
The live parts of my body are self healing/managing. The dead ones are not. There is still hygiene needed for the daily removal of sigma from the skin
(shower) but even that is primarily concentrated where sigma and dirt more commonly arise (head armpits genitals).
I would rather not have to cut my nails ever.
I don't gain any satisfaction from it.
I would rather if my hair never grow - even though I like my hairdresser the monthly visit to her is a similar annoyance to the quaintly visit to the garage shop for my  oil change.

I have been organize these above routine so as I can be jumping out of bed to online - in anywhere from 5 mins to 25 minutes - and I am very happy about it.
The amount of time/overhead that I have to spend dealing with my dead cell as well as with the dead excrements and byproducts is health-progress indicator
of the "ogt" machine.

Generalizing a bit I would be happier if I were to urinate with half frequency (or not at all) , or that I don't need to daily put antiperspirant to make my human pores excrete less human smell and sigma.
I have recently (last couple of years) stopped eating lunch. I still go to lunch with friends but while they are busily munching I can talk with whoever is not, getting the most of these encounters.
Maybe it is a more general trend.
