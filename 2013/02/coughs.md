Coughs
=================

Its hard to focus when you hear your kid having a nasty cough through the night - second night in a row.

I am trying to see if it gets better or worse - sometime it sounds worse - should I do something? What? More syrop? Many times I long having a grandpa, grandma in the house with home remedies and a calming/soothing having seen it all voice.

Maybe I should keep a log of the coughs as I hear them from the living room

They do seem to come in groups.  Now silence!  Could it be she managed to fall asleep?
