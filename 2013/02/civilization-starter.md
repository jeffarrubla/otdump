Civilization starter 
=================

I always want to think that I am fairly self-sufficient, in the sense that I depend on very few material things. Another way of saying this is that as longas I have my small backpack (which contains, laptop and associated parafernalia) I can just fly anywhere and be able to be productive - thus happy from where-ever I am. I guess thats not exactly true - there are a few things that I will probably be needing for a prolonged stay anywhere:

So I want to start compiling the list so as I can easily recreate my basic "civilization starter kit":
