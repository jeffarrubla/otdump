Should you leave your keys around?
=================

Looking to more ways to outsource work in an online way I recently thought that it would be cool to not have to take your keys to Ace hardware for copies.
And apparently there is a company that does that.
You take a few photos of your key with their iphone app and voila your key comes in the mail a few days later: [dittokey.com](http://dittokey.com/)

The interesting thing is that this idea will force another type of progress.
It will make clear that keys are plaintext passwords that provide access to your most valuable assets : your home, family, car etc.
Anyone can grab a photo of your keys in your keychain and when that becomes part of the plot of a popular movie... people will start looking for better alternatives than the old world keys.

I also found it interesting that the filament used in RepRap etc is sturdy enough that it can be used for key creation as well. [Here is a post about it](http://lifehacker.com/5120596/get-replacement-keys-cut-from-a-digital-photo).
