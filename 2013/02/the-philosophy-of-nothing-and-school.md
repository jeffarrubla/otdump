The philosophy of nothing and school interviews
=================

I just called my sister to congratulate her for her son's acceptance in a hard to get british school (6th grade kid) and she told me kind of bragging

"good thing I persuaded my son to not use nothing as his school interview discussion topic and use the olive branch thing instead".

I got kind of stuck:
Preparation and topics for 7th grade school interviews? (The school interview part I had already accepted - my son just did his too for a high school) And what is this "nothing thing".
My sister went ahead and explained that her son was fascinated with the philosophy of nothing, big bang, the impossibility and intrinsic logical inconsistencies that the concept of nothing entails and so on.
I was both excited and envious in some ways.
Kids (or at least some kids) can get interested/excited in concepts like that.
And what starts as philosophical debate quickly turns into scientific parallel and research.
I explained her that I spend some time a few years ago concluding that nothing doesn't exist.
And that if you use this as an axiom or  an equivalent axiom the universe always existed (ie is infinite) you end up (using layman's logic) to an alternative universe theory that doesn't have big bangs dark matters or funny forms of energy, where a constant steady inflation counteracts gravity and explains most of the astrophysics  in a way that can be understood by a elementary school kid.

My sister, contrary to most other people instead of debating with me and tell me I am out of my mind, asked me to find time and talk with her son :-).
And she went on explaining the final topic that her son picked. The olive branch. And its inherent contradiction of being chosen by ancient greeks as both the symbol of piece and the symbol of victory. And carried through time from Roman emperors and Pax Romana, the american dove? and Yasser Arafat holding the branch and a gun and saying provocatively "don't make me drop the branch..."... All that prepared by a 6th grader. The interviewer send a card to him a few days later saying "This is first I met a geek that is a greek!".  And told him he was accepted with honors.
