Superbowl and Nobel laureates
=================

I realized yesterday (from all the cars that were having these plastic flags in their car windows) that a bay area team was again in the finals. I thought that this just happen a few months ago.
I have been embarrassing myself when talking with friends by confusing the two teams 49ers and Giants but if I recall correctly the Giants were in their own final a few months ago.
I guess it is cool to be in the bay area then if you are a sports fun.
For that matter my soccer-playing kid was telling me that the soccer team of san jose was in (final?) playoffs with Galaxy the LA team. And even though hockey has been on strike for a year (I knew that) Sharks seem to be doing pretty well lately as well. I guess in every single sport bay area is rising to the top!. And wasn't it a month ago that someone made fun of me when Stanford beat my own college team in Roseball?

A: All this seems to be more than a coincidence.
B: Of course if you look for patterns you can always find ones.

A: But look at that:
The crown of the largest company by market cap moved to the Bay Area due to Apple.
It was before in Texas (XOM), Connecticut (GE), Seattle (MSFT)  (I confirmed the locations from wikipedia the top cap companies by memory)
Big Money => Big Sponsors => Stronger teams.

I still have in my todos to create a treemap of the public companies by location, something that would put some more clear evidence in my feeling that the $1T of value between decade-old companies like Apple, Google, Ebay, Yahoo, Facebook, Linkedin, Netflix, Workday, Salesforce, Netsuite, Groupon, Zynga,  (I follow these), while the massive decline of east coast Financial companies or anywhere else Telecom companies must be creating a various obvious trend/pattern.

The bay area, and with that I mean, innovation and startups is becoming the primary economic muscle of the global economy.  (I made a leap from America and the rest of the world - but anyone that finds US beating in technological innovation the rest of the world they should attempt the same comparison taking out of the equation the bay area. I don't think that US is winning. The Bay Area model is wining. And in that sense, any place that is creating a similar environment could very well "beat" the older world.
(For the record (and this may sound counter intuitive , I am always upset/offended when I talk to Bay Area folks that have the arrogance/illusion that they have a defacto monopoly in innovation by being in the bay area but thats another post )

So what about the Nobel laureate mentioned in the title?
A few weeks we heard about a Nobel Laureate leaving Harvard to join Stanford and we contemplated what is the ideal place for a future Nobel Laureate to do their research - the east coast Harvard? or the bay area Stanford. The answer was that several of the interesting new trends are happening here and are studied here. Stanford has already people excited about them - Harvard becomes aware of them after the fact.

So Stanford has a key advantage.
